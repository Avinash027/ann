üß† Practical 2: Generate AND-NOT Function using McCulloch-Pitts Neural Network (CO1 15)
Problem Statement:
Generate AND-NOT logic function using McCulloch-Pitts neuron model in Python.

üîç Theory in Hinglish (Point-wise + Detailed):
McCulloch-Pitts Model kya hota hai?

Yeh neural network ka simplest model hai.

Neurons ko binary input dete hain (0 ya 1), aur output bhi binary hota hai.

Sirf basic logical operations jese AND, OR, NOT, AND-NOT define karne ke liye use hota hai.

Concept Used: Threshold-based decision making.

McCulloch-Pitts Neuron ke Components:

Inputs (xi): Neuron ke input (0 ya 1).

Weights (wi): Har input ka weight (in McCulloch-Pitts, mostly 1 ya -1 fix hota hai).

Summation: sabhi (xi * wi) ka sum hota hai.

Threshold (Œ∏): Agar sum ‚â• threshold, output = 1; warna 0.

Output (y): Final binary output after applying threshold.

AND-NOT Logic Function:

Logic: A AND NOT B

Truth Table:


A	B	Output (A AND NOT B)
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	1
1	1	0
Weights & Threshold Design:

Assign w1 = 1 to A

Assign w2 = -1 to B

Threshold Œ∏ = 1

Working:

Sum = A * 1 + B * (-1)

Output = 1 only when A = 1 and B = 0 ‚Üí sum = 1 ‚Üí satisfies threshold.

Python Concepts Used:

for loop to test each pair of inputs

Simple if condition to check threshold logic

Use of numpy arrays (optional, for matrix version)

Basic print statements for output

Output Expectations:

Input: All 4 combinations of A and B.

Output: Correct value of A AND NOT B for each input pair.

Important Neural Concepts Applied:

Binary threshold neuron

Logic gate emulation using neural computation

Understanding of weight assignment to negate one input

Real-Life Applications (Logical to Neural):

Simple logical neurons jese McCulloch-Pitts ka use digital circuits simulation, early pattern recognition me hota tha.

Conceptual base ke liye important hai before moving to Perceptron and MLP.
